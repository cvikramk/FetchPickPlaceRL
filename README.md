# FetchPickPlaceRL

Experimenting with training an actor-critic model to teach a robotic arm to catch a falling object. 
The idea was to see if restricting the max episode length would result in any meaningful changes in learned policy.

## Experiment Results

## Note

Fetch environment has now been moved away from OpenAI Gym, this current repository will require some minor reworks to some scripts to work.
